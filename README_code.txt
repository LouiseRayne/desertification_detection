Introductory information
========================
Files included in the data deposit: 

The code files (GEE and Colab) run the same workflow, but for use in different platforms. 

1) desertification_detection_GEE
This code can be copied into Google Earth Engine (GEE)

2) desertification_detection_Colab
This code is to use in Colab 


========================== 
Methodological information
==========================
Running the code in Google Earth Engine or Colab executes an algorithm which uses free satellite data to detect desertification in the 
Skoura oasis of southern Morocco. Filtered data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites for the period 2021-6-1 to 2021-8-31 is used, 
as well as tasselled cap components derived from the same Sentinel-2 data. 

This can be adapted to any other location by redefining the geometry variable and the training data for the five classes. 

The results generated by this code were validated by comparing the output values at random sample points to high resolution images. 

For a full description of the methods and results, please see our related article.
